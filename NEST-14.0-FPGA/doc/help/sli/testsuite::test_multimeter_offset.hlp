Name: testsuite::test_multimeter_offset - Test if offset attribute works properly

Synopsis:

(test_multimeter_offset) run -> NEST exits if test fails


Description:

This test checks if the offset attribute of multimeter works as expected; 
contains 3 tests: 
1) checks if recorded times are indeed relative to an offset, and the first 
sampled time point is the offset itself 
2) check if data logger is initialized correctly 
3) ensures offset can only be set before the multimeter is connected to nodes 
4) ensures offset works correctly even if origin, start and stop are modified
