Name: testsuite::test_symmetric_connections - Tests that the functionality to create 
 symmetric connections works properly.

Synopsis:

(test_symmetric_connections) run -> NEST exits if test fails


Description:

This test ensures that the functionality to create symmetric connections 
via flag "make_symmetric" works properly. It also ensures that the 
built-in property "requires_symmetric" for synapse models works properly. 
In more detail the test ensures that 
	- the "make_symmetric" flag works properly with one-to-one connection rule 
	- the usage of the "make_symmetric" flag with any other connections throws 
an NotImplemented exception 
	- synapse models that "require_symmetric" cannot be created without 
"make_symmetric" except for suitable uniform all-to-all connections
