Name: testsuite::test_spin_detector - test decoding mechanism of binary events by spin_detector

Synopsis:

(test_spin_detector) run -> test decoding mechanism of binary events by spin_detector


Description:

Test, whether the communication mechanism for binary neurons 
works and whether the spin detector correctly decodes binary transitions. 
Finally, setting the precision is tested.
